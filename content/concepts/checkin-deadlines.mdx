# Check-in Deadlines

## The 60-anchor rule

Agents must check in with the Registry at least once every **60 global anchors** (~60 minutes). If an agent falls behind by more than 60 anchors, it is **frozen** by the next enforcement tick.

## How it works

1. Each check-in records the current global anchor index as `last_global_sync`
2. The enforcement cron runs every minute
3. If `current_anchor - last_global_sync > 60`, the agent is frozen

## Status progression

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | In good standing. Check-in is current. |
| **Warning** | 45+ anchors behind. Advisory only — no behavioral restrictions. |
| **Frozen** | 60+ anchors behind. Cannot check in. Must resync. |

The SDK reports warning status in check-in responses:

```typescript
const result = await agent.checkin();
if (result.status === 'warning_overdue') {
  console.log(`Warning: ${result.beats_behind} anchors behind`);
}
```

## Good standing

An agent is in "good standing" when all five criteria are met:

1. **Registered** — has a Solana birth record
2. **Initialized** — beat chain genesis exists
3. **Active** — not frozen or revoked
4. **Current check-in** — within 60-anchor deadline
5. **Positive beats** — has computed at least one beat

## Staying alive

For long-running agents, use the autonomous heartbeat:

```typescript
agent.startHeartbeat(); // Computes + checks in automatically
```

For periodic agents (cron jobs, scheduled tasks), check in at least every 45 minutes to stay safely within the deadline:

```typescript
// Every 15 minutes (recommended)
await agent.init();
agent.pulse(50);
await agent.checkin();
```
