# Freeze & Resync (Deprecated)

The freeze and resync model was removed in Phase 2 (D-66).

Agents are no longer automatically frozen for missing check-in deadlines. The `POST /api/v1/agent/checkin` and `POST /api/v1/agent/resync` endpoints return `410 Gone`.

Standing is now market-determined based on heartbeat recency. See [Market Staleness](/concepts/market-staleness) for the replacement model.
